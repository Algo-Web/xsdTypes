 * The type xsd:ID is used for an attribute that uniquely identifies an element in an XML document.
 * An xsd:ID value must be an NCName. This means that it must start with a letter or underscore,
 * and can only contain letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
 *
 * xsd:ID carries several additional constraints:
 *
 * Their values must be unique within an XML instance, regardless of the attribute's name or its element name.
 * A complex type cannot include more than one attribute of type xsd:ID, or any type derived from xsd:ID.
 * xsd:ID attributes cannot have default or fixed values specified.
